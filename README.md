### How to Play

The goal is to get your white shape into the black goal hole in the center.

* **Controls:** Click (or tap) and drag your shape to aim, then release to shoot. The further you drag, the more powerful the shot.
* **Rules:** Avoid the dangerous obstacle holes and moving pucks! Hitting moving pucks costs points and, eventually, lives.
